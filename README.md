# Basic Mathematical Operations and Personalized Greeting Program

This Python program performs two main tasks:
1. Basic mathematical operations between two numbers
2. Creates a personalized greeting using user's name

## Program Structure and Execution Steps

### Task 1: Mathematical Operations
- Step 1: Input Collection
  - Prompts user to enter first number (num1)
  - Prompts user to enter second number (num2)
  - Converts string inputs to integers using int()

- Step 2: Calculations and Output
  - Addition: Adds num1 and num2
  - Subtraction: Subtracts num2 from num1
  - Multiplication: Multiplies num1 by num2
  - Division: Divides num1 by num2
  - Prints each result with descriptive labels

### Task 2: Personalized Greeting
- Step 1: Input Collection
  - Prompts user for first name (f_name)
  - Prompts user for last name (l_name)

- Step 2: Greeting Generation
  - Uses f-string to concatenate:
    - "Hello, " prefix
    - First name (f_name)
    - Space
    - Last name (l_name)
    - Welcome message
  - Prints the complete greeting

## Key Features
- User-friendly input prompts
- Clear output formatting
- Basic error handling through integer conversion
- String formatting using f-strings


## Notes
- Program assumes valid integer inputs for numbers
- Division by zero will raise an error
- No input validation is implemented
